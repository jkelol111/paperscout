# Paper Scout
### A RSS feed reader for KaiOS.

## Project information

**TODO: insert screenshots**

Paper Scout is a RSS feed reader for KaiOS that uses the [Vanillai UI toolkit](https://github.com/jkelol111/vanillai). This app is sort of a test bed for new Vanillai things. For UI elements currently lacking in the Vanillai toolkit, we will create our custom ones here, and probably merge them back to Vanillai too.

Other than that, Paper Scout isn't that bad of a RSS reader too. You can subscribe to RSS feeds, read them in a chronological order, all with a beautiful 'natively'-styled KaiOS UI powered by Vanillai.

Until I get the basic Vanillai elements out of the door first, this repository will be just here as a placeholder/mockup. 

We might even abandon Vanillai altogether, who knows? Then this project would just use the stylesheets taken from Kaidi.

## Features

## License

We have yet to decide a license for this project. Hang tight!

## Monetization

This app contains KaiAds, an advertising service by KaiOS Technolgies intended for the monetization of apps listed in the KaiStore. If you do not want ads, you can always disable them from Paper Scout's settings.

If you're sideloading this app, you can change the boolean `adsEnabled` in the file `src/ads.json` to `false` to disable the ads permanently for your sideloaded version.
